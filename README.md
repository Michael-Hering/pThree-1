# pThree

pThree is a web-based application designed to enable individuals to create a playlist that will fit any occasion, and that everyone will enjoy. Now, wherever you go, whether it is a wedding or a road trip, you will have the perfect playlist.

Create an account on our website and share your username with your friends or party guests so they can submit Spotify playlists to your account. Once you are ready to create your playlist, just hit the button and we'll take care of the rest. Our algorithm combines all the playlists that were submitted to your username and creates a new playlist on your Spotify account with the tracks that your friends or guests will surely want to hear.
