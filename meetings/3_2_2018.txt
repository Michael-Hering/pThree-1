Debrief:

We began Milestone 2.
We decided our Project Management Tool will be GitHub Project Board and a GANTT Chart in Google Sheets.
We came up with project requirements and laid out a plan for our first sprint which will be to develop a "Create and Account Page" and "Login Page" with full functionality.ter
